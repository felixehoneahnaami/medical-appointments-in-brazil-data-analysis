## Summary of Findings

> About 20% of patients did not show up for their medical appointment

> The Age did not play a role in remaining 80% decision to show up for their appointment

> Irrespective of the status of the medical condition of the patient, majority attended their appointment. Clearly this did not have influence on their decision

> Sending reminders in the form of SMS to patients did little to their decision as the majority of the two sections (those who received an SMS and those who did not receive SMS) attended their appointment
